# Roadmap
Floe is an ongoing project that will have lots of backwards-compatible updates. We want to be able to release new features and improvements as soon as they're ready.

We're planning to release Floe v1.0 in Q1 2025. Here's what we're working on:
- Finish VST3 and AU support
- Complete the GUI for adding multiple libraries to a single instance
- Recreate the presets infrastructure and GUI
- Comprehensive testing of all plugin formats in all DAWs and operating systems
- Prepare a couple of Floe sample libraries ready for release

Later down the line, we're planning to:
- Refresh the GUI: make it more consistent and performant, and refactor the code for easier expansion
- Overhaul the audio & MIDI processing engine for easier expansion, such as: MIDI MPE, MIDI2, polyphonic modulation, sample-accurate automation, MIDI learn.
- Add more features to the sample library format to allow for more complex instruments: legato, key-switches, drums, etc.

Even further down the line, we're looking into:
- Allow for creating custom GUIs 'views' using the library Lua API
- Adding wavetable oscillators/granular synthesis as a option to layer with sampled instruments
- Adding a more comprehensive modulation system

Give us feedback on these using [Github's discussions](https://github.com/Floe-Project/Floe/discussions) section. FrozenPlain also have a Floe section on their [forum](https://forum.frozenplain.com/t/floe).
