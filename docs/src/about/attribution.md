# Attribution

Sample library developers can license their libraries in various ways. Most developers use a license that allows you to use the sounds without having to credit them.

However, some sample libraries do require you to credit the creator when you use the sounds in your music. Typically, the requirement is that you include a bit of text along with your music in a reasonable place, such as the description box, album notes, or credits.

The most common licenses that require attribution are the Creative Commons licenses, such as the [CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license. This license allows you to use the sounds for free, even in commercial projects, as long as you credit the creator.

Floe makes it easy to comply with these requirements. When you use a sound from a library that requires attribution, Floe will show a small icon in the top of the window. Clicking this will show you the exact text that you can copy and paste wherever you need to. Floe synchronises this list of attributions between all instances of Floe that are running, so you only need to do this once.
