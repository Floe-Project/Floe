# Previously known as Mirage

Floe is a continuation of FrozenPlain's Mirage plugin (developed from 2018 to 2024). It adds [new features and improvements](../changelog.md#mirage) but is similar in a lot of ways. Floe is backwards-compatible with Mirage libraries and presets. Mirage will no longer be developed.

### Why the name change?
The project has taken a new direction and so we decided to give it a new name.
- Floe is free and open-source, whereas Mirage was closed-source.
- Floe is not directly tied to FrozenPlain. It's a separate project that's open to anyone - we want to encourage growth of Floe without being tied to a specific company.
- Mirage is already the name of a hardware sampler from the 80s - we want to avoid confusion.

### Backwards-compatible with Mirage
Floe can load Mirage's libraries, presets and settings file. If you have Mirage installed already, Floe will be able to find the same libraries and presets as Mirage. 

You can leave Mirage installed if you want to keep using it: Floe will not interfere with Mirage's installation.

Floe is a new plugin with a new name and new internals, targeting new plugin formats. Floe can't replace Mirage automatically in your old, saved DAW projects.

### Installation is different
Floe has a new, offline installer. Sample libraries are installed separately using Floe Packages.
