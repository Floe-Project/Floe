# Preset Folders
Floe automatically scans for presets in a set of folders - including subfolders. This works in the exact same way as your [library folders](./library-folders.md).

Presets are tiny files and so there's typically no need to move then to an external hard-drive.

<div class="warning">
The preset features of Floe are under development and this page will be updated as things progress.
