# Develop Preset Packs

Developing preset packs is simply a matter of saving preset files into a folder and then packaging them into a [Floe Package](./packaging.md). Packages can contain libraries and/or presets.

Give presets a descriptive name suggesting their tone or usage. Don't use all capital letters. Don't include a 'type' prefix such as "PAD - " or "LD - ", instead, use tags when you save the preset.

The preset features of Floe are under development and this page will be updated as things progress.
