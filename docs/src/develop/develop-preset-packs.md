# Develop Preset Packs

Developing preset packs is simply a matter of saving preset files into a folder and then packaging them into a [Floe Package](./packaging.md).

Best practices for presets:
- Makes presets all feel the same volume: the master peak meter on Floe's GUI should just be the yellow zone when the preset is played at its fullest.
- Give each preset a unique, descriptive name suggesting its tone or usage. Don't use all capital letters. Don't include a 'type' prefix such as "PAD - " or "LD - ".
- Add as many tags as is relevant to the preset. Read more about tags on the [tags and folders](./tags-and-folders.md) page.
- Keep the description short and ending with a period.
- Organise presets into folders using your file browser. You can rename presets and folders as you like. See the best practises for folders on the [tags and folders](./tags-and-folders.md) page.
