<p style="text-align:left; font-size: 2rem; margin-bottom: 4px;">Floe lets you find, perform and transform sounds from sample libraries - from realistic instruments to synthesised tones. No-hassle, open-source and always free.</p>

Floe is an engine, *it requires sample libraries to play*.

#### Create expressive sounds
Floe loads libraries in the [Floe format](./about/sample-libraries.md), and provides an intuitive interface for shaping, layering and performing the library's sounds. Its a powerful audio plugin for sound design, music production and live performance. It excels at enabling exploration between realistic multi-sampling and sample-based synthesis. 

It's based on an architecture of 3 sound layers that can be shaped and blended together, and additionally processed with a rack of built-in effects. It features comprehensive systems for discovering sounds and presets, and for creating your own sample libraries (programming required).

#### Widely compatible
It's available as a plugin for your DAW (CLAP, VST3 and AU) on Windows and macOS. It's free and open-source and always will be due to its GPL licence. There's no lock-in, no sign-up, no nagging, just a focus on helping you make music.

#### Built on a solid foundation
Floe's ancestor, Mirage, has been used by thousands of musicians and producers in 13 products and been used in large-budget TV soundtracks. Floe is the next step in the evolution of Mirage, with a focus on developing a hassle-free platform for new sample libraries.

#### Ongoing development
Floe is an ongoing project. We plan to expand its capabilities while always maintaining backwards compatibility. We're always open to feedback and suggestions.

Developed by the creator of [FrozenPlain](https://frozenplain.com). FrozenPlain offer a range of sample libraries that are being updated to support the Floe format. We're looking to see other developers adopt the format too.

> **Floe's mission**
> 1. Make sample libraries more expressive, playable and effective in music production.
> 1. Lengthen the lifespan of sample libraries by providing a open-source platform for them with no lock-in.
> 1. Prioritise helping users make meaningful music; not technical hassle, commercial pressure or unnecessary complexity.
