# Installing Libraries & Presets

Floe installs libraries and presets from ZIP files called Floe Packages.

Simply click the 'Install package' button in Floe's settings panel and direct it to the package ZIP file. It will extract the libraries and presets into the correct folders. No need to restart Floe.
