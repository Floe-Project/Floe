# Installer

The typical way to install or upgrade Floe is to use the installer. 
1. Unzip the installer file. This is normally just a matter of double-clicking the file.
1. Close your DAW.
1. Run the installer program.
1. Follow the instructions, including choosing the plugin formats you want to install.
1. Done. Floe will be available to your DAW - but you might yet need to [install sample libraries](installing-libraries.md).

Floe is backwards-compatible. This means that you can install a new version of Floe over an old version. The installer does this automatically.

### The old Mirage installer
Previous, when Floe was known as Mirage, the installer would also install sample libraries. This is no longer the case. For Floe, sample libraries have a separate installation process. 

Additionally, the installer used to require an internet connection and an account or download-ticket. For Floe, the installer is just a simple offline program with no credentials required.
