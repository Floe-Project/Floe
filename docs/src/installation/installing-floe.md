# Installing Floe

There's two ways to install Floe: using the installer, or manually. 

Either way, Floe is backwards-compatible. This means that you can replace an old version of Floe with a new version and everything will work.

## Installer (recommended)

1. Unzip the installer file. This is normally just a matter of double-clicking the file.
1. Close your DAW.
1. Run the installer program.
1. Follow the instructions, including choosing the plugin formats you want to install.
1. Done. Floe will be available to your DAW - but you might yet need to [install sample libraries](installing-libraries-and-presets.md).

## Manual Installation

Normally you'll want to use the installer, but there could be some cases where you'd prefer to install Floe manually. To allow for this, we provide a zip file that contains Floe's plugin files.

### Windows:
- CLAP: Move `Floe.clap` into `C:\Program Files\Common Files\CLAP`
- VST3: Move `Floe.vst3` into `C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3`

### macOS:
- CLAP: Move `Floe.clap` into `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/CLAP`
- VST3: Move `Floe.vst3` into `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3`
- AU: Move `Floe.component` into `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components`

Next, you might need to [install sample libraries](installing-libraries-and-presets.md).
