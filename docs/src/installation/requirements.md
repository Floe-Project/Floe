# Requirements

### <i class="fa fa-windows"></i> Windows
On Windows, Floe is available in the CLAP and VST3 formats. We recommend using the CLAP version where possible. Requirements:

- {{#include ../../mdbook_config.txt:min-windows-version}} or later
- 64-bit computer
- x86-64 processor with SSE2 support (almost all processors in a Windows PC since ~2006 have this)
- 64-bit CLAP or VST3 host

### <i class="fa fa-apple"></i> macOS
On macOS, Floe is available in the CLAP, VST3 and AU (v2) formats. We recommend using the CLAP version where possible. Requirements:

- {{#include ../../mdbook_config.txt:min-macos-version}} or later
- Apple Silicon or Intel (Floe is a universal binary)
- CLAP, AU (v2) or VST3 host

### Plugin Hosts (DAWs)
Here are some examples of plugin hosts that can run Floe. There are many more than this.
- **CLAP** hosts on Windows & macOS: Reaper, Bitwig, FL Studio (2024 or newer) and Studio One Pro (v7 or newer).
- **VST3** hosts on Windows & macOS: Cubase, Ableton Live, Reason, and more.
- **AU** hosts on macOS include: Logic Pro, GarageBand, and more.

### Not supported
Just for clarity: there's no Linux, no 'standalone' application and no AAX (Pro Tools) support. We hope to expand Floe's compatibility in the future.
