# Uninstalling

Floe doesn't yet have an uninstaller program. But you can manually uninstall it by deleting Floe's files.

Firstly, you will want to delete Floe's libraries and presets. The easiest way to do this is as follows:
- Open Floe
- Click on the cog icon <i class="fa fa-cog"></i> at the top.
- For each of the paths click the open folder icon <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i>. This will open the folder in your file manager.
- Delete the folder that opens.
- Repeat this for each path.

Next, you can delete Floe's settings file.
