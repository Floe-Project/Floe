# Previously known as Mirage

Floe is a continuation of FrozenPlain's Mirage plugin (developed from 2018 to 2023). It adds new features and improvements but is based on the same core architecture. Mirage will no longer be developed. Additionally, Floe will start with a new version number (1.0.0) rather than continuing from Mirage's version number.

### Why the name change?
The project has taken a new direction and so we decided to give it a new name.
- Floe is free and open-source, whereas Mirage was closed-source.
- Floe is not directly tied to FrozenPlain. It's a separate project that's open to anyone.
- Mirage is already the name of a hardware sampler from the 80s - we wanted to avoid confusion.

### Backwards-compatibile with Mirage
Floe can load Mirage's libraries and presets. If you have Mirage installed already, Floe will be able to find the same libraries and presets as Mirage. 

You can leave Mirage installed if you want to keep using it: Floe will not interfere with Mirage's installation.

However, Floe is a new plugin with a new name that targets new plugin formats. Your old DAW projects that use Mirage will still need Mirage, Floe can't replace Mirage in that sense.
