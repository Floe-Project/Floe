## Antique IRs - Free

Give your presets a vintage sound using this library of impulse responses that simulate old audio equipment.

It's a Floe port of NoiseCollector's impulses response library; created with the use of public domain recordings of historical events. Vintage equipment like dicta-phones, old film reels, vintage vinyl, wax cylinders, and magnetic wire.

Impulses can be used to simulate war reports, old radio broadcasts, space missions, and other vintage sounds with a convolution reverb.
