# Attribution

## At a glance
If a sample library requires attribution:
- Floe will show you the required attribution text.
- Copy-and-paste this text alongside wherever you share your music.
- You own your music (sell it, relicense it, etc.) - you just need to credit the creator of the sounds.

The above bullet points assume the license is the "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International" license â€” a very common attribution-required license.

## About attribution-required licenses

A license tells you what you can and can't do with a sample library. Most developers choose a license that allows you to use the sounds in your music without having to credit them.

However, some developers choose an attribution-required license such as the widely-used [Creative Commons Attribution](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license (also known as "CC BY").

This license allows you to use the sounds for free, even in commercial projects, as long as you credit the creator by including a bit of attribution text along with your music. For example, you might include the text in a caption on your website, in the album notes or in a credits roll (or any ["reasonable manner"](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode.en#s3a2)). The music that you create with sounds under this license is yours: you can sell it, stream it, relicense it or give it away; you are just required to credit the sound's creator.

For some people, giving attribution is a deal-breaker. But here's some reasons why it might not be so bad:
- Attributions can support the creators of sounds - providing them with recognition, traffic, and potential customers.
- Sharing where your sounds come from helps other musicians find great sounds too - increasing the quality of music everywhere.
- Attributions can look professional and show a high level of care in your work.

## How Floe helps

Floe makes it dead-easy to comply with attribution requirements. When you load a sound from a library that requires attribution, Floe will show a small icon in the top of the window. Clicking this will show you the exact text that you can copy-and-paste wherever you need to. Floe tracks all attribution requirements across all instances of Floe, so you only need to do it once.
