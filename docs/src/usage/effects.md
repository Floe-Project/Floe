# Effects

![Effects](../images/effects.png)

Floe has a selection of ==effects-count== effects that can be applied to the audio. These effects are applied to the mix of the three layers. The effects are shown in a list on the right-hand side of the main panel. You can change the ordering of the effects by dragging and dropping the effect names â€” either the name in the rack or the name next to the on/off switch.
