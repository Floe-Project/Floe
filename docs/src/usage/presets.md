# Presets

Floe can save its current state as a preset file, which can be loaded later. It's the same file type regardless of what sample libraries you're using; a `.floe-preset` file. When you load a preset, Floe will check that you have the required libraries installed, and if not, it will show an error.

Presets are portable - you can copy them to other computers or operating systems. You can rearrange them into folders and rename them as you like.

## Preset browser

![Preset Browser GUI](../images/preset-browser.png)

Floe features a browser for conveniently navigating and loading presets from your preset folders. Filter presets using the left-hand panel, and select presets from the right-hand panel. You can also search for presets using the search bar at the top.

## Preset folders

![Folder Preferences GUI](../images/folder-preferences.png)

Floe automatically scans for presets in a set of folders - including subfolders. This works in the exact same way as your [library folders](./sample-libraries.md).

Presets are tiny files and so there's typically no need to move then to an external hard-drive.
