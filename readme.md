# Floe Source Code
___IMPORTANT: Large-scale changes are underway, many things are missing and broken for now.___

### Sample-based synthesiser plugin
This is the source code for Floe, a sample-based synthesiser plugin. It's [free software](https://fsfe.org/freesoftware/freesoftware.en.html) software developed by [FrozenPlain](https://frozenplain.com). It's available as a CLAP, VST3 or AU audio plugin for Windows and macOS. Linux is supported only for development purposes.

Floe requires sample libraries. These are created using the Lua programming language. Alternatively, FrozenPlain offer sample libraries to buy, and a few free ones.

## Roadmap
Floe will be updated and deployed regularly with stable, backwards-compatible releases. Currently we are working towards the first stable version, 1.0. We use GitHub issues to track the [milestones](https://github.com/Floe-Project/Floe/milestones?direction=asc&sort=title&state=open) towards that.

The work so far from Mirage (the old project) to Floe v1.0 has been related to building infrastructure for long-term, sustainable development. New features and improvements will be coming once we have a strong foundation.

Additionally, once we reach v1.0, we'd like to expand the number of sample libraries available and update Mirage libraries to Floe's new sample library format.

## Status towards v1.0
1. 游릱 Completed for the current requirements
2. 游릴 Works well-enough but doesn't handle everything
3. 游릳 Mostly works but some aspects are missing or broken
4. 游린 Fundamentally broken or not-yet-implemented

## Previously known as Mirage
Floe is backwards-compatible with Mirage's libraries and presets. See more information about this in the [user manual](https://floe.audio/mirage.html).

## License
This project is licensed under GPL version 3 or later. See the LICENCES folder for the full licence text. We follow the [REUSE](https://reuse.software/) recommendations for this repository.

## Building
Building is done on a Linux or macOS system. Cross compilation is supported. Therefore from Linux/macOS you can build for Windows and other platforms. 

However, Linux is only provided for development purposes at the moment, and you can't cross compile to Linux from a non-Linux system.

- Install Nix and enable Flakes
- Run `nix develop` in the root of the project to enter a shell with all dependencies
- Run `zig build compile -Dtargets=native`. Alternative options instead of `native` are: `linux`, `windows`, `mac_arm`, `mac_x86`, `mac_ub` (universal binary)

## Interesting development things
- Compile times are pretty fast and we do our best to keep them that way.
- We don't use the C++ standard library, and only sparingly use the C standard library.
- We only support one compiler: Clang (via Zig), and so we wholeheartedly use Clang-specific features and features from C++20/23 and above.
- Good tooling is a priority. The build system generates a compile_commands.json, so clangd, clang-tidy, cppcheck, etc. are all supported.
- We pair `Nix` with `just` for accessing great tools, being able to deeply integrate the project and be consistent across machines (local/CI/Linux/macOS).
