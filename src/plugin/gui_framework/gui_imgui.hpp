// An immediate-mode GUI system.
//
// The entire GUI is rebuilt every frame. There are no persistent widget objects. When you call a
// behaviour function (e.g. ButtonBehaviour), you're not creating or updating a widget - you're declaring that
// a rectangle with a given ID should have button behaviour *for this frame*. Next frame, if you don't call
// ButtonBehaviour for that ID, the button ceases to exist. The only persistent state is: which ID is hot,
// which is active, which has text input focus, and viewport data (which is mostly reconfigured each frame).
//
// Element Z-ORDER: The order you register elements within a viewport matters. Elements registered later in
// the frame logically sit "on top" of earlier elements. For example, if two overlapping rectangles both have
// button behaviour, the one registered later will receive mouse events and become hot/active, while the
// earlier one will be ignored. Internally, this is achieved by adding a frame of delay to these interactions
// (although our system actually immediately requests a re-run of the GUI in these cases).
//
// Viewport Z-ORDER: In general, viewports have the z-order rules as elements, however, we additionally offer
// some order-independent features for viewports. By setting the mode of a viewport config to Floating, Modal
// or PopupMenu, you break outside of the ordering requirement. Instead, you can use the z_order field (popup
// menus automatically handle this).
//
// IDs: Every element and viewport must have a constant, unique ID. This is how the system tracks the minimal
// persistent state (hot, active, text input focus). Use MakeId() with a string or number, or PushId()/PopId()
// to scope IDs hierarchically. Alternatively, hash anything that uniquely identifies the element: a string,
// pointer, SourceLocationHash(), or existing hash.
//
// It provides the building blocks for creating your own 'elements' (not widgets - they don't persist). This
// is a reasonably low-level API for handling UI interaction; it does not do any layouts, or any drawing.
// There should only be one Context per GUI window.
//
// The system is built around 'viewports' - containers that introduce their own coordinate system where the
// top left is the origin. Viewports are started with a 'begin' call and ended with an 'end' call. Inside
// these 2 calls, you build the UI elements by registering rectangles into the current viewport, calling
// 'behaviour' functions, and then drawing using the current draw-list.
//
// Behaviours can often be combined. For example, internally, 'draggers' just use both slider and text input
// behaviour on the same ID and rectangle.
//
// Viewports can be nested. Additionally, viewports can be configured to automatically handle scrollbars, and
// can configured as popup-menus or modals that sit on top of other viewports. While viewports have some
// persistent data (like scroll offset), they are mostly reconfigured each frame, and the viewport hierarchy
// is rebuilt every frame through Begin/EndViewport calls.
//
// There's 2 coordinate systems here: viewport-related (relative to the top left of the current viewport), and
// window-relative (relative to the top left of the whole GUI). It's mostly convenient to work using
// viewport-relative positions, and only convert them to window-relative for the final Behaviour* call and
// drawing. The internals of this system typically work with window-relative, but users of this API typically
// work with viewport-relative. IMPORTANT: any drawing is assumed to be window-relative.
//
// All sizes/positions in this system are pixels.
//
// There's still some technical debt here. This system has been ad-hoc built bit-by-bit over 10+ years.
