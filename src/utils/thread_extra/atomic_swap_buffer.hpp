// Lock-free triple buffer with atomic swap. Single producer, single consumer. Producer thread writes and
// publishes when it's done. Consumer thread can safely read blocks of data that are published.
// Super fast and simple but uses 3x the memory.
//
// If there is likely to be lots of contention, you might want to enable k_protect_alignment, which will align
// the buffers to avoid false sharing, however, this increases the size of this struct even more, to at
// minimum 384 bytes.
